Project Graph is a desktop application focused on quickly drawing node graphs, designed to help users efficiently create project topology diagrams and brainstorm ideas. Users can easily create and connect nodes through simple drag-and-drop operations, allowing them to build complex graph structures with ease. The tool also features a clear hierarchical structure that intuitively presents project relationships or data relationships.
